mtcars is a dataset describing the features of automobiles from an old magazine. It has 7 variables.
```{r}
mtcars
mtcars['mpg']
mtcars[['mpg']]
mtcars$mpg
```

The mean difference was `r mean(mtcars$mpg)`
```{r}
mean(mtcars[['mpg']])
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```
```{r}
mtcars
mtcars$cyl
unique(mtcars$cyl)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

**This is an R Markdown document.** Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
